# How to contribute

The starter files are used in the course videos and are the starting point for all students. Because it is starting point and if any pull request alters any of the core files, then it (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.

This repository is the outcome of the project. It is available for anyone who is interested for understanding and usage. However no contribution is expected because it is expected to be completed by the student.
